# Project 2: Continuous Control

[![Project passed](https://img.shields.io/badge/project-passed-success.svg)](https://img.shields.io/badge/project-passed-success.svg)

### Introduction

For this project, you will work with the [Reacher](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Learning-Environment-Examples.md#reacher) environment.

![Trained Agent][image1]

In this environment, a double-jointed arm can move to target locations. A reward of +0.1 is provided for each step that the agent's hand is in the goal location. Thus, the goal of your agent is to maintain its position at the target location for as many time steps as possible.

The observation space consists of 33 variables corresponding to position, rotation, velocity, and angular velocities of the arm. Each action is a vector with four numbers, corresponding to torque applicable to two joints. Every entry in the action vector should be a number between -1 and 1.

### Distributed Training

For this project, we will provide you with two separate versions of the Unity environment:
- The first version contains a single agent.
- The second version contains 20 identical agents, each with its own copy of the environment.  

The second version is useful for algorithms like [PPO](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.06347.pdf), [A3C](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.01783.pdf), and [D4PG](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=SyZipzbCb) that use multiple (non-interacting, parallel) copies of the same agent to distribute the task of gathering experience.  

### Solving the Environment

This poroject can be done with separated version of the Unity environment. 

+ **Single Agent Version:** It contains a single agent. 

+ **Multi-Agents Version:** It contains 20 identical agents. 

In this project, I choose version 1 with a **single agent**. The environment is considered solved, when  the agent must get an **average score** of *+30* over 100 consecutive episodes. 

### Environment Setting

The environment can be downloaded from one of the links below for all operating systems
  - Linux: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/one_agent/Reacher_Linux.zip)
  - Mac OSX: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/one_agent/Reacher.app.zip)
  - Windows (32-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/one_agent/Reacher_Windows_x86.zip)
  - Windows (64-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/one_agent/Reacher_Windows_x86_64.zip)

    
(_For Windows users_) Check out [this link](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/827218/how-to-determine-whether-a-computer-is-running-a-32-bit-version-or-64) if you need help with determining if your computer is running a 32-bit version or 64-bit version of the Windows operating system.

(_For AWS_) If you'd like to train the agent on AWS (and have not [enabled a virtual screen](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Training-on-Amazon-Web-Service.md)), then please use [this link](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/one_agent/Reacher_Linux_NoVis.zip) to obtain the "headless" version of the environment.  You will **not** be able to watch the agent without enabling a virtual screen, but you will be able to train the agent.  (_To watch the agent, you should follow the instructions to [enable a virtual screen](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Training-on-Amazon-Web-Service.md), and then download the environment for the **Linux** operating system above._)

### Project Structure

+ `Continuous_Control.ipynb` -  file containing the main code to initialize dependencies, environment and Agent
+ `ddpg_agent.py` - file that contains the characteristics of the agent and how it behaves through this task
+ `model.py` - file that contains the deep neural networks (DNN) architectures used by the agent
+ `checkpoint_actor.pth` and `checkpoint_critic.pth` - files that with saved DNNâ€™s weights, that solved the environment.

### Project Approach
The notebook Continuous_Control.ipynb contains the code to set up the environment and the outer episode iteration to solve the reinforcement problem. Our solution uses a **Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)** approach (only standard feedforward layers) with experience replay, see this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.02971.pdf).
